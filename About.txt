Welcome to the capecrusader.
I am a huge fan of Batman like others fan too. I started watching hollywood movies in late 2010`s. I started waching good movies like Forrest Gump, Saving Private ryan, Shawshank Redemption, etc,
But it was The Dark Knight, Which impacted me a lot as an spectator. I became loyal fan of Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Christopher Nolan and beleive me since then i have not stopped.

Here are my list as which i have watched sequentially:-

The Dark Knight
